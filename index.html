      <h2>Hello there!</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Hertfordshire in 2024 with a degree in Computer Science,
        and I am passionate about exploring data-related fields such as Data Engineering, Data Science, and Machine Learning.
        My fascination with these areas stems from a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential.
        I believe that to train robust AI models, one must begin with high-quality data, as it serves as the foundation for creating intelligent and reliable systems.
        This is the reason why I want to master the intricacies of data, from engineering its flow to extracting actionable insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Data Engineering, what interests me is the process of building efficient systems that manage, process, and transform both structured and unstructured data.
        By developing pipelines that ensure data is accessible, accurate, and timely, I want to enable organizations to unlock their potential by utilizing data.
        This field excites me because it lays the groundwork for successful AI applications. A well-designed data ecosystem ensures that
        machine learning models are fed with clean and meaningful data, which is critical for their performance and accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in Data Analysis and Data Science is rooted in their ability to transform raw information into actionable insights.
        To me, data analysis is like embarking on a fact-finding journeyâ€”listening to the story the data tells and using it to make informed decisions.
        Whether it's helping a business optimize its operations or identifying trends that shape the future, this field provides a unique opportunity to bridge numbers with real-world impact.
        Data Science, on the other hand, takes this process a step further by using advanced algorithms and predictive models to foresee trends and outcomes.
        I am particularly interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Data Science, where systems become autonomous and capable of solving complex problems,
        ultimately reducing human workload and driving innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career goal is to contribute to building intelligent systems that empower businesses and individuals to make better decisions,
        enhance productivity, and unlock new possibilities. By combining my expertise in data with my enthusiasm for AI and Machine Learning,
        I want to be at the forefront of creating solutions that shape a smarter, more efficient future.
        This portfolio reflects my dedication to these fields and provides a glimpse into the projects
        and skills that have prepared me to tackle real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p> 
        My technical skills encompass <Strong>Python(including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras), Java (beginner level)</Strong>, and relational databases such as <Strong>MySQL and PostgreSQL.</Strong> 
        I am also proficient in <String>Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau, and AzureSQL</String>, with a strong focus on data visualization and analytics. 
        Currently, I am enhancing my expertise by learning <Strong>Apache Airflow and Kafka</Strong> to build efficient ELT pipelines. 
        Additionally, I am expanding my knowledge in <Strong>NoSQL, Data Warehousing,</Strong> and distributed processing frameworks like <Strong>Spark and Hadoop</Strong>,
        also I am planning to enhance my skills in cloud services like <Strong>Azure and AWS</Strong> as well. While mastering these skills is challenging,
        I am committed to learning them systematically, one step at a time. Currently, my primary focus is on acquiring skills related to Data Engineering,
        as I already possess a strong foundation in Data Analytics. Once I achieve proficiency in data engineering, 
        I plan to enhance my expertise in Machine Learning and AI Engineering. The skills related to data engineering will act as foundation towards learning these skills in ML and Ai.
        With these skills, I aim to gain practical experience and achieve a high level of proficiency in these areas, which will be instrumental in achieving my long-term career goals

    <div class="goals-content">
      <p>
        In my future career path, I am deeply interested in two fields: robotics and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).
        These areas represent my passion for exploring the cutting edge of technology and its applications to solve real-world challenges.
        By focusing on these fields, I aim to showcase my commitment to advancing technology and contributing to innovative solutions that can benefit industries and individuals alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        In robotics, I want to focus on developing intelligent autonomous systems capable of seamlessly interacting with their environments.
        By integrating advanced robotics with AI, I want to design solutions for real-world challenges,
        such as optimizing manufacturing processes, building autonomous drones, or developing service robots for healthcare and logistics.
        Exploring the intersection of robotics and machine learning will enable me to create such systems. I am particularly interested in applying robotics to automate labor-intensive tasks,
        enhance safety in hazardous environments, and reduce human workload.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces, I am fascinated by the potential to bridge human cognition and technology.
        BCIs offer groundbreaking possibilities for improving human-machine interactions by enabling direct communication through neural signals.
        I want to delve deeper into this domain, developing applications that improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities,
        enhance neuroprosthetics, and facilitate immersive virtual and augmented reality experiences.
        This path will involve mastering neuroscience, signal processing, and machine learning to decode and interpret brain activity effectively.
        By contributing to BCI technology, I hope to advance innovations that enhance human capabilities and redefine the future of human-computer collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aspire to delve deeper into one of these fields, dedicating myself to mastering its complexities and pushing the boundaries of innovation.
        Given the advanced nature of both robotics and Brain-Computer Interfaces,
        I am determined to excel in whichever path I pursue, making meaningful contributions.
